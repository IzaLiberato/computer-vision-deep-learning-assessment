# Computer Vision and Deep Learning

This repository contains a project focused on computer vision and deep learning techniques, covering three main tasks: image object counting, people detection, and car type classification.

## Contents

- **OpenCV Object Counting**  
  Implementation of an image processing pipeline using OpenCV to detect and count objects.

- **YOLOv8 People Detection**  
  Application of a pretrained YOLOv8 model to detect and count people in an image.

- **Car Type Classification**  
  Development of a deep learning model to classify types of cars using the Stanford Cars dataset.
